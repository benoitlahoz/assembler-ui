# Welcome to AssemblerUI

AssemblerUI is a modern, accessible, and customizable Vue component library built on shadcn-vue principles. It provides a comprehensive collection of beautiful components that you can copy, paste, and customize to fit your project's unique requirements.

## What is AssemblerUI?

AssemblerUI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of copy-and-paste components that you can use in your projects. Pick the components you need, copy the code, and customize them to match your design system.
